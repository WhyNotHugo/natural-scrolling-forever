natural-scrolling-forever
=========================

This package includes two scripts:

* `natural-scrolling`: Enables natural scrolling for all currently connected
  devices.
* `natural-scrolling-forever`: Monitors for device changes and enables natural
  scrolling when new input devices are connected.

The latter script requires that you install `python-xlib` as well.

Support status
--------------

This script works fine. It's reached its "stable" point, and won't receive any
more support. However, since I've moved from Xorg to Wayland, I'm no longer
supporting this (I'm not even running it).
