natural-scrolling-forever
-------------------------

This package includes two scripts:

* `natural-scrolling`: Enables natural scrolling for all currently connected
  devices.
* `natural-scrolling-forever`: Monitors for device changes and enables natural
  scrolling when new input devices are connected.

The latter script requires that you install `python-xlib` as well.
